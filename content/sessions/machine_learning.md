Machine learning for cyber security is one day hands on training session to be conducted at Seasides. This training is crafted for students and entry level industry professionals who are interested in machine learning to understand cybersecurity risks and tools/techniques that can be used to mitigate those risks.

This training does not require prior knowledge of machine learning. But it is expected to have basic python programming knowledge. Training will cover basics of machine learning including supervised and unsupervised machine learning. It will also cover real world case studies related to cyber securi
