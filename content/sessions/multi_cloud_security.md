Enterprises across the globe are moving to the Cloud Technology. The technical understanding and enormous cost of rewriting infrastructure applied applications to re-platform and work with the new cloud concept is a difficult task. The irregularities caused due to mis-understanding / deficit
knowledge of New Cloud Concepts offered by leading Cloud Service Providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure and GCP etc have introduced multiple loopholes easily identified and exploited by Threat Actors to abuse and exploit the organization infrastructure.

Trainee will progress through advanced Real-World Cyber Attacks against various major Cloud Vendors like AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP's) simulation in the lab environment. 

Following topics will be covered during the session:
<ol>
    <li>Attacking - AWS Cloud Environment</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Enumerating & Designing Attack Surface of AWS Cloud Services</li>
        <li>Pivoting & Lateral Movement using AWS VPC</li>
        <li>Post-Exploitation by abusing mis-configured AWS Services</li>
        <li>Data Exfiltration from S3, RDS, STS & Secret Manager etc</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Attacking - Azure Cloud Environment</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Enumerating & Designing Attack Surface of Azure Cloud Services</li>
        <li>Pivoting Azure Control Plane to the Date Plane</li>
        <li>Stealth Persistence Access of Azure account by Service Principal</li>
        <li>Privilege Escalation by abusing mis-configured Role Based Access Control</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Attacking - Google Cloud Environment</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Enumerating & Designing Attack Surface of Google Cloud Services</li>
        <li>Post-Exploitation by abusing mis-configured Google Cloud Services</li>
        <li>Privilege Escalation by exploiting mis-configured OAuth & IAM</li>
        <li>Persistence Access of Google Cloud by Temporary / Permanent Access Token</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Attacking - Hybrid Cloud Environment</li>
    <ul>
        <li>MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud</li>
        <li>Enumerate & exploit widely used SaaS Services like O365 & G-Suite</li>
        <li>Exploit Trusted Relationship for expanding the access</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
