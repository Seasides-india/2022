**Abstract**: What is CANalyse?

CANalyse is a software tool built to analyse the log files in a creative powerful way to find out unique data sets automatically and inject the refined payload back into vehicle network. It can also connect to simple interfaces such as Telegram for remote control. Basically, while using this tool you can provide your bot-ID and be able to use the tool's inbuilt IDE over the internet through telegram.  

CANalyse uses python-can library to sniff vehicle network packets and analyse the gathered information and uses the analysed information to command & control certain functions of the vehicle. CANalyse can be installed inside a raspberry-PI, to exploit the vehicle through a telegram bot by recording and analysing the vehicle network.
