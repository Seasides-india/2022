With the advent of serverless computing, the developers no longer have to worry about servers. The infrastructure management tasks like capacity provisioning, patching, etc. are handled by the cloud service provider allowing developers to focus only on writing the code.

Serverless architecture is said to be more secure compared to traditional architecture. However, this does not mean that attacks cannot be performed on it. This course is focused on attack vectors on the Azure and AWS serverless application stack. 

The class will be conducted on our cloud-based, state-of-the-art lab platform where attendees will be doing 15+ unique lab exercises in class! Over 90% of class time will be spent on these hands-on labs!
