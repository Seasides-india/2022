**SEASIDES 2022**

Seasides is a community-driven security conference. The motive of this event is to provide free of cost premium workshops and training, with conference experience on par with Blackhat/DEFCON. The journey of Seasides started in 2018. Since then, we have held two physical conferences in Goa and a few online workshops. We started our journey with OWASP,  from  this  year  onwards  the  conference  will  be  managed  by  Seasides Technology.  

Sponsorship  is  completely  independent  of  speaking  slots.  Seasides  does  not  allow distribution of attendee lists, or use of them for anything other than conference updates.

**Target Audience:**

We target the industry professionals, security researchers and students looking to augment their  current  security  skill  set  with  that  of  the  advancements  in  cybersecurity.  We recognize the value in engaging a smaller audience to develop connections and learn. Apart from building one’s technical skills, our conference will provide an avenue for professional networking, career guidance and build relationships.
