**Experts at making you an expert**

We are Vouch. The goal-getters, the game-changers. United in our mission to build complete
trust in the digital world. Trust connects us. It’s our driving force. It’s at the heart of everything
we do. We build trust to power interconnectivity. We build trust by removing the need for it,
and we use that trust to do more than ever before. We’re continually reimagining how we can
connect and interact better. For all the connections we want to make. For all the experiences
we want to create. For a new generation of connected products and services. For today, for
tomorrow, for our interconnected future.

We’re a tech company that connects the physical and digital worlds to help make intercon-
nectivity safe, secure, and private for everyone and every thing. Because we believe in a world
where people and things should be able to communicate with complete trust, trust that every
connection is authentic and free from corruption. To enable businesses of all sizes to make the
most of the opportunities our fast-changing digital world offers. To provide consumers with the
convenient and secure experiences they value. We believe that trust should be accessible to
everyone, everywhere, and we’re passionate about doing what’s right, for our customers and
the people they serve, for our communities and the cities we live in, for a better interconnect-
ed world.

Vouch was set up in Atlanta in 2019, and since then, we’ve continued to build on trust. We’re a
fast-growing, globally distributed company, powering the security and interconnectivity of peo-
ple and things in new ways. We’ve gone from logging into apps and websites without passwords
to digitally unlocking cars and driving immersive connected-car experiences. From opening
doors and garages at home to making highly-engaging hotel experiences accessible for guests
and employees. And we’re not stopping there. When we began our journey, we asked ourselves
a question, what would we do with complete trust? Now, we invite you to do the same.
