Hi, this is Shashank, CEO & Co-founder of Credshields.com, a web3 security company, and we are building SoldityScan.com, a cloud-based smart contract security scanner. I have over 12 years of experience in security, starting as a bug-bounty hunter in 2013. In the past, I have worked as a security analyst at HackerOne and security engineer at Deriv.
