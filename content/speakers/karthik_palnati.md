I have ten years of working experience in Red Team, Vulnerability Assessment and internal and external Penetration Testing assignments. 
I hold security certifications that include CRTP and OSCP. I formerly worked with Defence Research & Development Organisation, contributing to the security of the Ministry of Defence's web applications and assisting in cyber deterrence. 
NCIIPC recognized my efforts and dedication to reporting security flaws in various government websites. I have also participated in many Capture the flag and Bug Bounty programs.
